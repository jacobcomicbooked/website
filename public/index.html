    <p>Welcome to 3rd Level Comics Official Website!<br><br>
    3rd Level Comics was a long time in the making kind of project. It has seen some rough times and fortunately had the pleasure to see some good times as well. 3rd Level Comics is currently expanding its borders and always developing new plans for the future. 3rd Level Comics is meant to be set apart from the rest and be recognized as a completely independent company. We strive to promote local talent and help those who have been struggling in the comic book world to have their voices heard. We will be adding some new stuff down the road and even working in conjuction with one or two other independent companies. We are also seeking to expand our staff of Writers, Web Content Writers, Editors, Web Designers and more. So stay tuned and enjoy this little slice of comic book heaven!</p>
