	<h2>I Like Comics. Can You Relate? [February 10th, 2013]</h2><br><p>"Hey, what sorta things are you into?"

"Me? Oh, well, I like comic books."

"Oh...cool...Did you see the Green Lantern movie? It stunk."<br><br>In the past year, I've been more open about being a comic book lover. Now, don't judge me too quickly. I've liked comics since my teens, but never really discussed them to friends. Yes, I would own superhero shirts of various kinds. Yes, it's easy to talk about movie blockbusters like Avengers and even not so greats like the aforementioned GL flick (I liked it, though). However, it has only been recently that when asked about my interests or hobbies that comic books comes up as my first response. And so the conversation that usually follows with a brief pause and a redirection to a movie featuring a superhero.

Seriously, that's fine. Every once in a while, though, the person I'm talking with might continue with a "I used to read..." or "I liked..." referring to their childhood. I love those responses. I end up talking about some of those books if I've read them and talk about where they are now. The greatest surprises always come when I say how great The New 52's Aquaman is now.<br><br>Now, I feel like the nerd chic is in. The rise of movies like the Avengers, Nolin's Dark Knight films, and the Iron Man movies (to name a few) have excited children and adults alike about superheroes. Thanks to stores like Old Navy, people want to sport superhero logos. Even television shows like Big Bang Theory have raised an awareness. Now, I know of the controversy of Big Bang Theory, but even though it pokes fun at the geek genre, comics are highlighted into the mainstream. Maybe Big Bang Theory wasn't a good example. The Walking Dead is better. When I talk to co-workers about the show, I tell them it was a comic first, and they want to know what will happen next or what is different between the two.<br><br>

It is just so much easier to talk comics these days, and with all the different comics out there, it's fun to find a comic for a non-reader.<br><br>- Brian Du Pont</p>
	<h2>Review: Green Arrow #16 & #17 [February 10th, 2013]</h2><br><p>Anne Nocenti and Freddie Williams II continue to amaze Green Arrow fans drawing the attention of fans to the books versus the new CW TV Live-Action adaptation of Green Arrow. "To Reclaim A City" continues from where it left off at with issue #15 following the events with Harrow. This is Part 2: Battle For Seattle. One can have their own interpretation as to what "Battle For Seattle" means with issue #16 based on the events taking place within.<br><br>Oliver tries to keep a level head while struggling to stay positive in his current position. After all, he practically lost everything he knew at this point in time.<br><br>The first few pages becomes a heavy hit to Oliver/Green Arrow emotionally when the police to show up to shut down the illegal dog-fighting ring during the on-going parade that day only for Ollie to realize that Harrow has the police in his pocket making Ollie feel as though not only is his world falling apart around him but the good he tried to do for the city has been all for nothing leaving his actions without meaning. However, Gloria shows up acting like Oliver's salvation very suddenly revealing to Oliver that Pike has explosives rigged to a vest he is wearing threatening to blow himself up. On the way to save Pike, Gloria reveals the location of Harrow's weapons cache adding up to the severity of the situation between Harrow and Pike. Pike has the weapons cache below him wired and spliced and connected to the trigger on his vest on the roof.<br><br>Despite Oliver's downward spiral and the random help by Gloria, we get to see a humanity rising within Oliver increasing the tensions between Pike and Oliver. Green Arrow turns on his infamous charm to talk with Pike to attempt to talk Pike out of detonating the trigger rigged to the explosives downstairs in the weapons cache. The most touching moments of this book showcases Oliver's <i>unofficial</i> fatherly talents to soothe Pike and distract him so Oliver can sneakily remove the trigger from Pike's vest. For fan's of Green Arrow - especially New 52 Green Arrow - this issue slowly rose to be an "on-the-edge-of-your-seats" story.<br><br>Harrow decides to get in the middle of Oliver's distraction to no avail. Pike takes Oliver's bow and shoots an arrow into Harrow's thigh causing tensions to rise further. Although specific details I felt were only added for dramatic effect and seemed unnecessary, the art rendition added a little more to the story. Pike is saved and given over to authorities while Harrow is blown up by his own doing along with the weapons cache. Oliver walks away with a new outlook on life adding up all the recent events realizing his saving grace:<br><br>"One arrow at a time."</p><h2>Green Arrow #17 - The Kill Machine pt. 1</h2><br><p>There isn't too much to say about Green Arrow #17 - The Kill Machine pt. 1. To get it off my chest, bringing on a new team to continue Green Arrow was a terrible move! The only thing I can give props for was the story-line. The art, not-so-much. You really don't have to know what has happened up to issue #16 in order to understand what's <i>really</i> going on with Green Arrow due to the sudden change from where Oliver leaves off at in #16 to where he continues from in #17. Issue #17 begins to go back to Oliver's company he once had ownership over, "Q Core" and the battle with his subtle-villain "Emerson" - the new owner of Q-Core. Emerson was about to reveal that Oliver had a one-set destiny to follow since his birth and part of that destiny entailing Q-Core and other assets before Emerson was shot by a zip-line arrow from a mysterious assailant in the building across the street from Q-Core. Security inside the building think it is Oliver who murdered Emerson causing Oliver to defend himself and take down the security officials in order to hunt down Emerson's killer.<i> We can only speculate how that's going to turn out</i>.<br><br>The rest of this issue will be left spoiler free and you will need to go pick up this title for yourself.<br><br>Negatives: The art - BIG TIME!! The off-set colors and the boxes to highlight specific objects and actions become a huge annoyance very quickly!<br><br>Positives: The story-line. The end of the story was crazy!</p>
	<h2>Review: Aquaman #16 "Death In The Deep" [February 10th, 2013]</h2><br><p>Aquaman #16 carries out a few extraneous details that continues to make the reader feel on-edge and wanting to know more making it a real page turner. Cyborg is shut down temporarily to receive an upgrade whilst attempting to discover the origin of the trigger that caused U.S.S. Mabus' missiles to fire and hit Atlantis. Aquaman, in the public eye, was speculated to be turning against the Justice League and fighting for the invading Atlantean Armies.<br><br>This issue is a very heavy pivotal point for the series considering who it is we find out who was behind the mysterious attack causing the invasion. Aquaman ultimately teams up with Batman to rescue Superman and Wonder Woman from the trenches only to discover an ancient carving within the trench detailing a depiction of Orm holding the infamous scepter that not only can it control the Atlantean and Trench Armies but also has the power to sink continents. However, later on in the book it is discovered that Orm does not possess the scepter so now we're left to wonder who has the scepter or perhaps where it is located so Aquaman can turn back the Atlantean Armies. While Aquaman and Batman rescue Superman and Wonder Woman from the trenches, Hawkman and his associates to include various other super-heroes race against time to fend off the invading Atlantean Armies. We see here that most fending them off are concerned about whether or not they should <i>kill the invaders</i> or simply subdue them. This is a viable concern considering the rest of the superheroes fighting are unaware of the power of the scepter.<br><br>Vulko's rage about humans and Aquaman becomes a little more prevalent and we learn here who's controlling the coming army from the trench to include the Atlantean Army as well. And that would be Vulko himself. He now possesses the the infamous scepter.<br><br>What will happen to Boston?<br><br>Will Vulko be successful or will the Justice League amongst others be able to stop him in time?<br><br>Find out the epic conclusion in Justice League #17!</p>
	<h2>Review: Arrow - "Betrayal" [February 10th, 2013]</h2><br><p>In more ways than one!
The show continues to ramp up in a very level headed sort of way allowing us fans to have a little room to breathe. However, I believe that room to breathe was too early in the season considering what we were supposed to expect from the producers that just didn't make an appearance. For example, official sources cited Jessica De Gouw's aka The Huntress appearance in last night's episode which obviously failed. So what does this mean for the show? Or for the producers for that matter?<br><br>
Nothing in particular yet thankfully. However the script does tease John Diggle's potential future with Oliver and his alter-ego "Arrow" after John follows Oliver's mother around which makes Oliver very unsettled. John learns what we as fans of the show already know of Moira. And that she is full aware that the Queen's Gambit was sabotaged putting Moira in a position to be seen as a sort of enemy in Diggle's eyes.
In the meantime, David Anders plays as Cyrus Vanch, a career criminal seeking to take over the criminal world and rule it for himself. His female counterpart reveals that there is a mole inside the same police headquarters as the one Quentin Lance, Laurel's father, is in thus putting Laurel in harm's way. Now not only Laurel's father is using her as bait but now Cyrus uses Laurel as a means to take down Arrow.<br><br>
Quentin makes an unexpected decision he thought he would have never made in his life. He teams up with Arrow to take down Cyrus Vance and rescue his daughter Laurel.<br><br>
Now for the most important part.....Oliver comes to terms with the fact that his mother knows more than she has been letting on about the list possibly making him not think rationally when he suddenly confronts his mother in a very unexpected manner.<br><br>
"MOIRA QUEEN, YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY!</p>
	<h2>Review: Arrow - "Vertigo" [February 2nd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Apart from my stance in the last episode of Arrow "Trust but Verify" - Last Wednesday's episode "Vertigo" seemed to have a little bit more of a solid ground when it came to action to drama ratio. From Oliver's time on the island to the confrontations with Count Vertigo, the producer's of this show seemed to have a steady flow with the script.

One of the bits I was more interested in with this episode was how the producer's explained a little bit more about Oliver's time on the island and his capture by Deathstroke's crew. Arrow's confrontation with Count Vertigo was great however I want to focus on Oliver's time on the island.<br><br>

As we come to expect from Deathstroke, we see more of his talents played out in this episode. However, a short couple minutes of screen time which seems to become the norm for this hulking character. Oliver was pitted against his once thought to be savior on the island in what seems to be a like "King of the Ring" match. In Oliver's weary state against a man who more than shows off his martial art abilities, Oliver is easily defeated.<br><br>Despite Oliver's time on the island had shorter screen time than the current days of him being back in Starling City - we get to see a bit more on what Oliver discovers about the people around him and more importantly what Oliver is capable of doing which is clearly showcased in Oliver's current days in Starling City as he began his journey towards confronting Count Vertigo.

The show continues to ramp up into something better starting two episodes ago. One can only hope that the show will continue on their current direction. However, there's only one let-down coming from the Official Arrow website and that's the newly released stills previewing next Wednesday's episode showcasing Oliver's and Deathstroke's aka Slade Wilson's "friendly" interaction.</p>

	<h2>Pre-Con Event Coverage [January 11rd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Earlier tonight, my friend Gabriel and my Wife (Elyssa) helped me to get to the Pre-Con Event for the Amazing Arizona Comic Con to acquire a bit of coverage. What I did not expect was who was actually going to be at the Pre-Con Event. I was told it will only be people like local talent and those who help in building the Amazing Arizona Comic Con.

Upon my arrival, I saw some familiar faces like local internationally known Comic Shop owner Jesse James. What I didn't expect to see was the famous AZ Power Girl Cosplay woman and Toni Darling. Even better was who I saw next. And that was JOHN FRIGGIN' LAYMAN himself. You may know John Layman from his work with Batman and Chew. The best part of the evening, getting the chance to interview him personally and drink a pint of beer with the man! :-D. You wouldn't believe how big of a honor it was to be sitting there interviewing John Layman while drinking a pint of Guinness.

I got the chance to meet a lot of other amazing local talent waiting to get a break in the industry and those that are newcomers to the industries as well.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
