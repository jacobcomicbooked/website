	<h2>New Team Member [January 23rd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Hello everyone, Melody here! I have kindly been assigned as your new lead blog writer by Jacob and I am very excited to get started! So let's start off with a little background story of who I am and why I'm here. My name is Melody Shaner and I'm 21. I'm originally from Phoenix, Arizona but I live in Connecticut on a naval base where my husband currently works. I am a mother of an energetic one year old baby boy who, when I'm not chasing after, I will be typing away tirelessly much needed reviews on the newest comics, anime, games, ect. I'm hoping to bring to the table the energy, motivation, and talent 3rdlevelcomics may need in order to grow. Another big thank you to Jacob for this opportunity and welcome all new readers! Be on the look out for more updates and our new monthly newsletter!</p>

	<h2>Pre-Con Event Coverage [January 11rd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Earlier tonight, my friend Gabriel and my Wife (Elyssa) helped me to get to the Pre-Con Event for the Amazing Arizona Comic Con to acquire a bit of coverage. What I did not expect was who was actually going to be at the Pre-Con Event. I was told it will only be people like local talent and those who help in building the Amazing Arizona Comic Con.

Upon my arrival, I saw some familiar faces like local internationally known Comic Shop owner Jesse James. What I didn't expect to see was the famous AZ Power Girl Cosplay woman and Toni Darling. Even better was who I saw next. And that was JOHN FRIGGIN' LAYMAN himself. You may know John Layman from his work with Batman and Chew. The best part of the evening, getting the chance to interview him personally and drink a pint of beer with the man! :-D. You wouldn't believe how big of a honor it was to be sitting there interviewing John Layman while drinking a pint of Guinness.

I got the chance to meet a lot of other amazing local talent waiting to get a break in the industry and those that are newcomers to the industries as well.</p>
