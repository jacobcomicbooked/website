	<h2>Review: Arrow - "Vertigo" [February 2nd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Apart from my stance in the last episode of Arrow "Trust but Verify" - Last Wednesday's episode "Vertigo" seemed to have a little bit more of a solid ground when it came to action to drama ratio. From Oliver's time on the island to the confrontations with Count Vertigo, the producer's of this show seemed to have a steady flow with the script.

One of the bits I was more interested in with this episode was how the producer's explained a little bit more about Oliver's time on the island and his capture by Deathstroke's crew. Arrow's confrontation with Count Vertigo was great however I want to focus on Oliver's time on the island.<br><br>

As we come to expect from Deathstroke, we see more of his talents played out in this episode. However, a short couple minutes of screen time which seems to become the norm for this hulking character. Oliver was pitted against his once thought to be savior on the island in what seems to be a like "King of the Ring" match. In Oliver's weary state against a man who more than shows off his martial art abilities, Oliver is easily defeated.<br><br>Despite Oliver's time on the island had shorter screen time than the current days of him being back in Starling City - we get to see a bit more on what Oliver discovers about the people around him and more importantly what Oliver is capable of doing which is clearly showcased in Oliver's current days in Starling City as he began his journey towards confronting Count Vertigo.

The show continues to ramp up into something better starting two episodes ago. One can only hope that the show will continue on their current direction. However, there's only one let-down coming from the Official Arrow website and that's the newly released stills previewing next Wednesday's episode showcasing Oliver's and Deathstroke's aka Slade Wilson's "friendly" interaction.</p>

	<h2>New Team Member [January 23rd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Hello everyone, Melody here! I have kindly been assigned as your new lead blog writer by Jacob and I am very excited to get started! So let's start off with a little background story of who I am and why I'm here. My name is Melody Shaner and I'm 21. I'm originally from Phoenix, Arizona but I live in Connecticut on a naval base where my husband currently works. I am a mother of an energetic one year old baby boy who, when I'm not chasing after, I will be typing away tirelessly much needed reviews on the newest comics, anime, games, ect. I'm hoping to bring to the table the energy, motivation, and talent 3rdlevelcomics may need in order to grow. Another big thank you to Jacob for this opportunity and welcome all new readers! Be on the look out for more updates and our new monthly newsletter!</p>

	<h2>Pre-Con Event Coverage [January 11rd, 2013]</h2><br><p>Earlier tonight, my friend Gabriel and my Wife (Elyssa) helped me to get to the Pre-Con Event for the Amazing Arizona Comic Con to acquire a bit of coverage. What I did not expect was who was actually going to be at the Pre-Con Event. I was told it will only be people like local talent and those who help in building the Amazing Arizona Comic Con.

Upon my arrival, I saw some familiar faces like local internationally known Comic Shop owner Jesse James. What I didn't expect to see was the famous AZ Power Girl Cosplay woman and Toni Darling. Even better was who I saw next. And that was JOHN FRIGGIN' LAYMAN himself. You may know John Layman from his work with Batman and Chew. The best part of the evening, getting the chance to interview him personally and drink a pint of beer with the man! :-D. You wouldn't believe how big of a honor it was to be sitting there interviewing John Layman while drinking a pint of Guinness.

I got the chance to meet a lot of other amazing local talent waiting to get a break in the industry and those that are newcomers to the industries as well.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
